### Project Report: Inverted Indexer with TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity

#### Abstract
This project focuses on building an inverted indexer using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and computing cosine similarity for text documents. The objective is to create a system that can efficiently index documents and retrieve relevant documents based on a given query. The next steps involve integrating this indexer into a search engine application and evaluating its performance with a larger dataset.

#### Overview
The solution involves creating an inverted index for a collection of text documents using TF-IDF. This index allows for efficient retrieval of documents based on keywords. Additionally, the cosine similarity matrix is computed to measure the similarity between documents. The proposed system provides a foundation for building search engines and information retrieval systems.

#### Design
The system's capabilities include creating an inverted index, computing TF-IDF scores, and calculating cosine similarity between documents. The interactions involve processing text documents, creating vector representations using TF-IDF, and computing similarities using cosine similarity. The integration is seamless, with components working together to provide efficient document retrieval.

#### Architecture
The software components include a TF-IDF vectorizer and cosine similarity calculator from the scikit-learn library. The system uses pickle files to store the inverted index and cosine similarity matrix. The interfaces involve reading text documents, creating vector representations, and computing similarities. The implementation is straightforward, with components integrated to provide indexing and retrieval functionalities.

#### Operation
To operate the system, users need to provide a collection of text documents in a specified directory. The system then processes these documents, creates an inverted index, and computes cosine similarity. Installation involves setting up a Python environment with the scikit-learn library installed.

#### Conclusion
The project has been successful in creating an inverted indexer using TF-IDF and computing cosine similarity for text documents. The system demonstrates efficient indexing and retrieval capabilities. Further development could involve integrating this indexer into a search engine application and evaluating its performance with a larger dataset.

#### Data Sources
The data source for this project is a collection of text documents stored in a specified directory.

#### Test Cases
Test cases involve validating the correctness of the inverted index and cosine similarity matrix. Coverage includes testing various query inputs and verifying the relevance of the retrieved documents.

#### Source Code
The source code for the project is available on GitHub and includes documentation for installation and usage. The project depends on the scikit-learn library for TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity calculation.
